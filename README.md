## Machine Learning

### Time Series

Modeling and Forecasting Industrial Production of Electric and Gas Utilities in the U.S.

This project seeks to develop a forecasting model for precise predictions of the industrial production of gas and electricity in the United States. The methodology involves an initial dataset examination to detect potential seasonal patterns and trends using time series plots and ACF/PACF plots. For data normalization, the Box-Cox transformation is applied, followed by differencing to achieve stationarity. Various techniques are employed to identify (p’s and q’s), select (AICc value), and validate (Portmanteau Statistics) candidate models. The final model successfully forecasted the next 10 months of industrial production, as evidenced by forecasted values falling within the confidence interval and closely aligning with actual values. Through this project, we can provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making, guiding investments, and infrastructure development efforts in the future.


### Classification Projects

Exploration of Bank Churn Rates
  
The purpose of this project is to explore the bank churn rates using a dataset that contains information about customers of a bank. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, credit score, geography, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card ownership, and estimated salary. The main goal is to identify the factors that are most strongly associated with customer churn and develop a predictive model to help the bank proactively address the risk of customer attrition. By analyzing the dataset, we hope to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences that can inform the bank’s customer retention strategies. Ultimately, the aim of this project is to help the bank better understand its customers and improve their overall experience with the bank.

Predicting Diabetes
https://github.com/PSTAT197-F23/Vignette-of-Binary-Classification
This project aims to utilize machine learning for binary classification to predict whether a female patient (at 21 years old and of Indian heritage) has diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, glucose, blood pressure, etc. The dataset, sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Disease, consists of eight medical predictors and a single  “Outcome” variable. The primary objective is to develop a robust binary classification model that accurately predicts the presence or absence of diabetes in the specified demographic.
